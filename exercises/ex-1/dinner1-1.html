            You had a wonderful choice of breakfast and dinner. Both were full with healthy nutrients needed for your body to function. However, you skipped your lunch. Skipping meals results in slower metabolism which means that you burn less energy. What does this mean? You're prone to gaining weight which leads to numerous things you don't want!</p>

            <p>But it's okay, the good news is that you just have to make one simple change. Maybe try ordering delivery food that's healthy? Try Bibibop or Chipotle! If not, maybe pack some fruits as snacks? You're on good track so with a small change, you'll be great!</p>
