            STOP IT!! You're eating way too unhealthy. Did you know that an unhealthy diet is THE leading reason for death? I know that changing your diet at once will be frustrating, but you should really try to incorporate more nutrious food. What about getting fastfood once a day instead of twice and eating home-made healthy food at least once a day?
