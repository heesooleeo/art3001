<h1>Heesoo's Very First Web Blog/</h1>
    <p>January 24, 2021</p>

    <p>This week we learned how to code a .html website using Visual Studio Code. Following Hirad and Dalena’s instructions actually made me remember a class I took in High School. I think it was named Web Design class where we used Visual Studio Code as well. My very first coded website was named “Hello World” and I also remember making a website similar to Amazon – but very basic. What I never knew before is called a Github. We learned how to push our codes to the Github repository and write some comments per push. While I don’t really understand Github itself nor what repository means, I think the concept of Github is very similar to Google Drive or an iCloud. Github just deals with coding.</p>

    <p>I was naturally geared towards the sciences and mathematic department my whole life growing up. I may know a lot of scientific knowledges but I always knew that I was lacking in other departments like art and coding which requires way more creative mindset. ART 3001 is a combination of the two things I always wanted to learn and conquer. I’m very excited to find out what else I’ll get to learn this semester.</p>

    <p>Aside from this course, I made a huge achievement these past two weeks. Before I start, I want to mention that I’m a very picky eater and that I love to gather enough information before I start whatever I have to start. Here the key word is “enough.” It seems like I take much longer gaining enough information on a topic to be satisfied than others since I’m looking to understand everything I learn about. In other words, I like to do the work instead of others doing the work for me. For example, if I were to cook a mashed potato, I would look up best type of potato for mashed potato and a quick google search tells me that it’s the Yukon or the Russet potatoes. A normal person would just choose one of those potatoes and go with it right? Well, I like to learn about every single potatoes available in the market and find why each are good or bad for mashed potatoes. </p>

    <p>Due to these similar reasons, cooking was something I put off for the past 2 years I been living alone for the first time. However, the last 2 weeks, I finally decided that I should just limit myself to a couple of ingredients and find a recipe that uses all those ingredients so I can just commit to one recipe and stop buying delivery foods. For this week specifically, I limited myself to chicken thighs, spinach, mushrooms, and pasta which made searching for the recipe so much easier for someone with a complicated mindset like me. Sounds very simple, but I’m very proud of this. </p>
