                    <p>This week was a continuation of my Facebook Marketplace addiction. Fortunately (or unfortunately), I had another huge success. I been wanting to invest in a good pair of headphones, specifically Sony’s WH-1000m4 or Bose’s Quiet Comfort 35 ii or iii, and somehow I found them on the marketplace. Now, I was kind of skeptical of buying a used/new headphone online because 1. What if it’s a counterfeit item? 2. I’m not sure how I like using a used headphones…I don’t know it may just be me but headphones obtain sweat, etc. But I found a Bose qc35 ii for only $100… and its description stated that it was only worn once… So basically both its description and the price made me rethink my standards hahaha These headphones are around $300 new and I wasn’t sure if I would get enough use out of them for that price. But for $100? That’s not too bad. I’m also living with a roommate next year so having a headphone with a noise cancellation feature might save me from being stressed from having a roommate… because I’m pretty sensitive to any type of sound when I’m studying. I need 0 sound or I get easily annoyed… </p>
            
                    <p>So to get back to the point, that was my thought process of being more acceptable towards a used (well once but there’s still a chance the guy lied) headphone so I thought, why not go check it out in person? If it turns out it’s authentic and it doesn’t look beat up, I’ll get it. According to the internet, there are apparently a lot of counterfeit Bose items and a lot of them look exactly the same on the exterior. As in, you can’t really tell if it’s a fake item from its looks. So I got worried again but I found out that if the headphones connect to the Bose app, it’s authentic. And guess what. It connected AND looked pretty new. So, I bought it on the spot loll.</p>
            
                    <p>But when I got home, I was still skeptical that the headphones maybe fake. It connected to the app and all but I have a tendency to double check everything. So, with a quick google search, I found out that if you call Bose, they can let you know if the item is real or not using the serial number. It turns out that I did actually purchase an authentic Bose headphones. </p>

                    <p>Welp that’s how my $100 was spent a couple of days ago. I keep telling myself that it’s a good investment for my future with my roommate lol
