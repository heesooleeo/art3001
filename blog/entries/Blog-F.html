                    <p> I made some changes to my project 1 website. Instead of making my composition notebook as my main theme, I replaced it with a nature background. The grid background is what I truly wanted, the more I thought about it, it’s just not professional looking so I decided to make a compromise by making only one section with the grid background. The nature background is still somewhat muted and earthy toned so it’s still what I like. In addition, I found another logo for my ‘dental office’ since the last one was way too childish. This one is simpler yet unique-ish but not in a childish way and not too adult-like either which I like

                    <p>As for my personal life, I visited a couple of Columbus suburbs in hopes of potentially finding a place I want to settle down in the future. I haven’t really went around the suburbs here until last week (during our “spring break”) and I was quite shock at how rural everything was, or at least compared to the Cleveland suburbs. This reminded me once again on why I didn’t want to stay in Ohio later, but I did find one suburb I might be ok living in – New Albany, OH. 
            
                    </p>So before I explain a bit about New Albany, I’ll talk about what I’m looking for in a city. Personally, I loved living in DC (I lived 5min walking distance from the White House before!) or Seoul, South Korea so my ideal living city is a safe, walkable, clean place with lots of entertaining things to do and good public transportation. However, from what I know there’re only 2 cities in the US that follows those criteria –DC and NYC. NYC is too dirty and crowded in my opinion. DC is amazing but it’s way too expansive to live there and even the suburbs are expansive (VA area). But still, basically what I’m saying is that Ohio is far from what I want.
            
                    <p>But if I’m going to be a dentist, I know that I probably shouldn’t live in a metropolitan city since it’s saturated with dentists and this will make me live like a college student for way too long (I have to pay back my debt). So I been in a search for my compromised, ideal future city. New Albany is still very Ohio-like but the majority of the buildings there are made of BRICK which I LOVE. The houses there are beautiful as well. But I did find out that New Albany is one of the wealthiest city in the Midwest so maybe that explains why I found it a potential city for me haha
