                  <p>This week consisted of our second instructional break. I know a lot of people complained (and still do) about how our spring break is divided, but I honestly kind of like 2 separate breaks better. I had less workload for two weeks instead of for only one week (well they are all crammed for next week but still lol) and I felt like I had an extra weekend in the middle of the week. I still feel like we should have minimum 3 instructional break since a normal spring break is technically 9 days long and instructional breaks are only 2 days long each.

                    But anyways, during this instructional break, I went on a food road trip – and when I said road trip, I meant it literally since I didn’t walk around anywhere (except for a couple of foot steps in). I first went to the Cleveland area to visit my favorite Mexican restaurant. Since I don’t feel comfortable eating at restaurants, I ordered my favorite chorizo tacos in Mexican street taco style over the phone and just went into the restaurant to pick it up. It was the first time I ate tacos using a fork and a knife in my car, but it tasted amazing.

                Shortly after, I visited my old hometown (Westlake, OH) and stopped by a park to digest all the food I ate to prepare myself for another long drive to Ann Arbor for dinner. Although I love Westlake and I will always love Westlake, I realized once again that Ohio is not for me lol. This day may have been the last day I’ll ever visit Westlake so I drove by my ex-house one last time. The new owners definitely changed the house a lot. They seem to love animal statues and America lol There were multiple American flags everywhere along with huge deer statues.

               <p>As I mentioned before, the last stop of the road trip was Ann Arbor, MI. I mainly went there for a pizza place that’s delicious but I also wanted to take a last(?) look at University of Michigan. While I’m committed to go to Houston for dental school. University of Michigan was my #1 choice since they’re the best dental school in the world. I’m still not 100% sure I made the right choice by declining my offer. I love their campus and the program. Weather not so much, but I don’t like Houston weather either. Maybe I’ll apply to Michigan for specialty if I choose to do so in the future…</p>
