                  <p>My college graduation is almost approaching but it doesn’t feel like anything, yet. Maybe it’s because I have at least 4 more years of school? I don’t think I’m even going to attend the graduation in-person either – although others are really happy that we were given a chance to attend it in-person. If COVID wasn’t a thing, I definitely would. But I don’t even feel like college will be over any time soon. I still haven’t ordered my cap and gown nor have I thought about what I’m going to be wearing for graduation pictures.

                    To be honest, I’m more worrying about this art final as of right now. I have no idea what I want to do and the proposal is due in 2 days. A couple of weeks ago, I thought I wanted to continue working on my project 1/dental website but eh. I do want to start a pre-dental blog mainly because I heard that you can make some side money with ads. But I’m not too sure on how to even start that or if I’ll be committed enough to update the blog throughout the school. I don’t really want to think about dental stuff right now either since I’ll be doing that until I retire lol.

                So I think I want to create a story of my dog’s life using gif, some hovering/complex CSS animations, and procreate. The only problem is, I don’t know how to create/use any of those 3 I just mentioned haha and using procreate wasn’t as easy as I thought it was… I guess we will see what I decide on by Tuesday.

               <p>Oh and a short update on my veggie eating journey. I added zucchinis to my edible list of vegetables. Arugula was just awful – I don’t know why people like it. Bell peppers were eh. I also don’t see why some people eat it as snacks, but hopefully one day I’ll be able to do that. I’m going to be eating eggplants for the first time this week. I wonder why they’re called “egg” plants. </p>
