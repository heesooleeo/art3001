        <p> This week we only had studio time. I decided to go with the composition notebook themed background instead of starry night themed one since I thought the grid background describes me better. It’s a little hard to explain but I’m very connected to composition notebooks. I have been using these notebooks almost every day of my life since high school and this is a way for me to study, figure out a plan, or just write down any necessary information. I fold every page in half to utilize every single grid on the page and go through at least 1 composition notebook per year.  </p>

        <p> Anyways, since I’m going with the whole grid theme for my future dental office website, I’m trying to put a line below my headers using hr html code to imitate drawing a horizontal line with a pencil. However, it’s not as easy as I thought it would be. Since I incorporated a grid system as my background, I can’t seem to figure out how to get the horizontal line (hr) on the composition grid line (if that makes sense). I also can’t seem to figure out how to incorporate javascript into my website. I plan on making my website a one scroll vertical page but even when I copy and paste javascript codes I find online, it doesn’t seem to work. I’m kind of worried about how I can get this project to work before the deadline.</p>

        <p>As for what happened this week, I might have realized why I feel so bloated every single day of my life (almost). I think I may be gluten intolerant. Every time I eat something sweet like donuts, crullers, churros, brownies, or even chips, I feel very sick and nauseated but I always ignored them thinking it was just me eating unhealthy things. But I realized that others don’t ever feel like this after eating these items with flour. I made a doctors appointment next Tuesday so we will see what the problem is. I really hope that I’m not gluten intolerant and something else is the problem. I mean what food doesn’t have flour in it???? Sigh. </p>
