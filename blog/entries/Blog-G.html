                    <p>Project 1 was turned in this week. I would say that it took more work than I realized so I wasn’t able to finish the non-art parts of the websites. But overall, I’m about 70% satisfied with my result. Maybe 100% considering that this is my first time actually coding. But anyways, when Hirad was screensharing my website to the class, I learned that if I use my laptop screen size is a base, the website might look funky on different size monitors – which was the case with Hirad’s. So all the work I put in to have the texts and pictures fit on my composition grid background for blogs didn’t mean anything. Oh well. At least I now know so I’ll try to work through it next time I code something.</p>
            
                    <p>I also found other people’s websites very intriguing. I forgot who but someone’s website allowed people to move around mac folder looking icons just like how you would move a folder on a desktop. Someone else had a stick figure person dancing which was super cool. What was even better was that the person was on a 3D composition notebook grid-like background that was interactive. That’s literally what I wanted to do so now I know that it’s somewhat possible if I were to want to do it later. But apparently the guy used javascript so maybe it’s not possible lmao. CSS, I can somewhat figure it out from reading numerous coding websites but javascript is something I couldn’t figure out yet. Maybe one day I will idk.</p>
            
                    <p>Back to the cooking blog, this week I tried to recreate my favorite Mexican dish – Chicken Mole. One of my closest friends in high school is Mexican and whenever I went over to her house, her mom would make me the best chicken mole. I learned that she (and many other Mexican people) makes mole using a store-bought sauce that’s sold at Walmart so I was like why not try to make it on my own? I watched a couple of youtube videos and it didn’t look hard at all. Well, for some reason, the sauce tasted nothing like my friend’s mom’s mole so… I ended up throwing everything away… I still don’t know what I did wrong. I followed the exact recipe, and used the same ingredients as my friend’s mom. I guess I’ll have to ask her to teach me her recipe if she’s okay with that in the future.   </p>
