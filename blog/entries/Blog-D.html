                    <p> We were given a more detailed instruction on project 1 during class this week. I thought I was following the coding stuff very well the past few weeks, but it seems like that wasn’t the case &#128517. I’m very confused as to how to connect everything we learned into creating a website that I have in my head. Luckily though, Dalena chose my website design to give the class tips on coding so I kind of have an answer key now. Despite this advantage, I might redesign my website. I wanted to have some interactive function but I don’t think that’s possible (yet maybe).</p> 
                    <p>From the lecture, I learned that using illustrator to make a rough draft of the website can be helpful for coding. Kind of like mapping the whole website with color blocks. I like being structured/planned so I might take this tip but since I don’t have any clue on how to use the illustrator, I think I’ll improvise by using the old-school method of pen and paper. Idk we will see. </p>
            
                    <p>As for food, today’s Valentine’s Day so I decided to make a dessert for my boyfriend. Now, the problem was that my plan was to make chocolate dipped strawberries and I completely forgot that literally everyone else will most likely be doing the same thing as me. Well, I went shopping the night before Valentine’s Day to buy some strawberries and literally 3 stores were all out of strawberries. Feeling completely hopeless, I just bought some pretzels and cashews to replace strawberries. But I thought why not just try Walmart and yay they had some left. But I had to buy 2 separate boxes to get some big strawberries but I guess it’s worth it. I attached a picture of what I made on the blog.</p>
            
                    <p>To continue my food blog, I didn’t actually make anything this week since my boyfriend cooked. I had some steak with broccoli and mushrooms with mashed potatoes for the past couple of days. I think I’m done with steak for awhile &#128514. I plan on finding more recipes so I can decide what I want to eat for the next few days lol I think I’m also done with chocolate stuff since I made way too many chocolate covered things. I really shouldn’t have bought pretzels haha </p>
