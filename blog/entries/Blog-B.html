        <p>We continued to learn more about the basics of coding. We specifically started to incorporate CSS in our coding. CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a coding language (I think) that allows users to be creative with different fonts, sizes, and more on HTML. We also learned non-CSS ways to decorate our HTML with normal coding language (?) that we learned last week. Some examples are how to create unordered/ordered bullets, breaks in the page (apparently using spaces in coding doesn’t mean much), applying different background color to the web, and much more. I took what I learned to redecorate my Blogs section. I first went on fonts.google.com to find a realistic handwriting font to match the aesthetics of my online web diary. I then changed each Blog pages’ background color to something fall-muted tones. I also resized the font size as well as the picture. So far, coding doesn’t seem too hard to follow yet. I hope that this is the case for the whole semester.</p>

        <p>Last week, I documented a part of my food journey. I’ll continue that this week as well and maybe, this will be a trend in the future. Anyways, one thing I failed to mention before is that I’m a very picky eater who despises vegetables. The amount of vegetables I had in my entire life is probably alarming. As I get older each year and now that I’m in charge of cooking, I decided to at least try to eat some vegetables one by one for my health. I added mushrooms to my diet two weeks ago. This week I added carrots and broccoli. Since I’m not brave enough to directly taste them, I decided to make Broccoli Cheddar Soup. This option was perfect for a couple of reasons: 1. I tried a spoonful from Panera’s broccoli cheddar soup and it wasn’t too bad 2. There’s cheese which will probably help mask the vegetable tastes 3. Veggies are in soup so it’s probably very soft/not crunchy. All in all, the final result of the recipe wasn’t horrible. I still had to swallow while holding my breathe but I’ll focus on the fact that I’m one step closer to being healthier and hopefully living longer as well. </p>

        <p>Aside from this course, I made a huge achievement these past two weeks. Before I start, I want to mention that I’m a very picky eater and that I love to gather enough information before I start whatever I have to start. Here the key word is “enough.” It seems like I take much longer gaining enough information on a topic to be satisfied than others since I’m looking to understand everything I learn about. In other words, I like to do the work instead of others doing the work for me. For example, if I were to cook a mashed potato, I would look up best type of potato for mashed potato and a quick google search tells me that it’s the Yukon or the Russet potatoes. A normal person would just choose one of those potatoes and go with it right? Well, I like to learn about every single potatoes available in the market and find why each are good or bad for mashed potatoes. </p>

        <p>Another quick thing to note is that I realized how similar yet different my soup tasted from Panera’s soup. I put A TON of butter and cheese (or at least it was from a beginner cook’s perspective!) and it still didn’t taste like Panera’s. I wonder how much of the fattening/bad ingredients they have in it… </p>
