                    <p>This week was a pretty busy week, not with school work though (midterms are over yay), but with Facebook Marketplace. A week or so ago, my dad called and asked about what I’m going to be doing with all my belongings when I graduate. My answer? Uh I never really thought about it but he was right that my graduation is coming up real quick (“graduation” lol) and I had 0 plan. My dad offered to drive all the way from Texas to OSU with a rental truck or uhaul to bring my stuff back but that seemed like too much work and my belongings aren’t that valuable enough (except for my couch!). So I decided to sell some of my items on Facebook Marketplace. </p>
            
                    <p>Never did I know that my items that were untouched for months or even years was valuable for others. A couple of my clothes were sold within an hour of me posting them. To be honest though, I think I sold them real cheap lol so that’s probably why and all my clothes that I sold were basically new. For example, I sold my $500 north face jacket for $100 that I worn max 10 times? Sigh but the jacket was too warm for a typical Ohio winter weather and that meant it’s probably going to be useless in Texas so I guess + $100 is better than -$500. I also sold my Burton snowboarding boots for $55 that was worn less than 10 times. Sigh. I still have all my other snowboarding gears but I don’t think I have the guts to sell them for that cheap. I might drag them with me to Texas somehow. Are there even places to snowboard in Texas though? Sigh.</p>
            
                    <p>But! The good news is that since I made some money, I decided to shop on the marketplace for myself AND I found a lululemon align leggings in diamond dye shade!!! I been wanting to purchase this leggings in this shade for the longest time but couldn’t decide whether > $100 was justifiable for a color I wasn’t 100% sure I would get its best use out of (I’m more of a solid, neutral, muted color person). But I found a brand new align leggings for $70 on the marketplace which I negotiated to $60. That’s literally 50% off. Apparently the girl that sold them to me was also a black leggings kinda person so she wasn’t sure if she loved the leggings. But since she took the tags off, she couldn’t return it so she decided to sell them on the marketplace ahhaha. I really never understood why some people were obsessed with facebook marketplace, ebay, or craglists, but I think I get it now. I hope I don’t get addicted haha</p>
